The Foreign Credentials Referral Office (FCRO) was established in 2007. Its mandate is to provide internationally trained individuals with the information, path-finding and referral services to have their credentials assessed and recognized. The FCRO is also responsible for guiding and monitoring the implementation of pre-arrival services. Annual progress reports on foreign credential recognition highlight Government of Canada accomplishments in this field.
