The Newcomer Settlement Program (NSP), supports immigrants, refugees and citizens in their settlement and adaptation process. Settlement Counselors assist clients either one on one or in a group setting to overcome day-to-day challenges, find out about available services of benefit to them, and support them as they integrate into their communities. Various workshops are conducted every month on various settlement related topics such as landlord and tenant rights, the Ontario school system, and parenting in Canada, government programs and services, healthcare etc.
