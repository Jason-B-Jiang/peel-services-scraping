The service has two components, available to all refugees in their first two years in Toronto: Psychiatric consultation and, when appropriate, brief culturally sensitive interventions for newly arrived refugees (eg., GARs, PSRs and refugee claimants) with psychological issues or concerns; Case consultation for primary care providers with access to psychiatrists and social workers for discussion and advice on client/patient cases.
